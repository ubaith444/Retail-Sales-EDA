# Retail-Sales-EDA
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset, combining sales data, store information, and external features (e.g., temperature, fuel price, markdowns). The goal is to extract insights that can help businesses understand their sales trends and make better data-driven decisions.
